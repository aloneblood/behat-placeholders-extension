Feature: Runtime Placeholders
  In order to make the test suite more flexible
  As a Context writer
  I need to use placeholders on my steps and hooks

  Background:
    Given a file named "features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php" with:
      """

      class FeatureContext implements Context, PlaceholdersAwareInterface
      {

         public function setPlaceholdersRepository(PlaceholdersRepository $repository)
         {
            $this->placeholders = $repository;

        }
